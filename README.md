# ImageCaptioning

**Image Captioning with Vision Transformer and GPT-2**

This project demonstrates how to build an image captioning system by combining computer vision and natural language processing. We use a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) model for feature extraction from images and GPT-2 for generating captions.


**Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib pillow torch torchvision transformers


**Usage**

Step 1: Import Libraries
Step 2: Load Pre-trained Image Captioning Model
Step 3: Preprocess Images
Step 5: Display Image with CaptionStep 4: Generate Caption
